The data are a subset of the US Postal Service Database, and we downloaded them from the
web page of the book "The Elements of Statistical Learning", Hastie, Tibshirani and
Friedman (2001). Springer-Verlag.

"dzip.dat" and "azip.dat": The first is a vector that holds the digits (the number) and the
second is an array of dimension 256 x 1707 that holds the training images. The images are
vectors of dimension 256, that have been constructed from 16 x 16 images.

"dtest.dat" and "testzip.dat" hold the test data.
