  \frametitle{The R programing language}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item R is an implementation of the S programming language inspired by Scheme.

  \item S was created by John Chambers while at Bell Labs in the 70's.

  \item Up to that time, much of the statistical computing was done by directly
    calling Fortran subroutines; however, S was designed to offer an alternate
    and more interactive approach.

  \item R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of
    Auckland, New Zealand.

  \item R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and
    partly as a play on the name of S.

  \item R is currently developed by the R Development Core
    Team, of which Chambers is a member.

  \item R is the top statistical language in the TIOBE index which is also
    above the commercial software SAS.

  \item R can be easily used in Big Data analysis platforms, e.g. Hadoop/Spark.

  \end{itemize}

\frametitle{Installing R}
Installing \textbf{R} on your own computer is simple and free.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you use Microsoft Windows, visit
  \url{http://www.r-project.org/}. It shipped with a simple graphical user
  interface (GUI).

\item R is available for Mac OS X users with a nice build-in graphical user
  interface, visit \url{http://www.r-project.org}

\item If you use Linux, search the phrase ``r-cran'' in your system's software
  repository. Any text editor can be used to edit R source code. But if you
  want a graphical user interface, \textbf{RStudio} (with is easy to install and also
  available for other platforms) is a good start. Please visit
  \url{http://www.rstudio.org/download/desktop}.
